## Flashbots Managed Workflows with Apache Airflow
This repository is used for the maintenance of directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs, used by Apache Airflow to manage operations on our internal pipeline. DAG's are automatically uploaded to a bucket in S3 from this repository, where they are stored and accessed by Airflow. Additional scripting or infrastructure required for the deployment, maintainability, or testing of these graphs may be included.
